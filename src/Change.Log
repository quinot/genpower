with 73-0724 Cable and running RedHat Linux 6.2 (Intel)

1.0.1 (1995/07/07)

The package has been renamed to genpower (Generic Power 
Monitoring for Linux).  After the release of unipower 1.0.0, I 
was informed by Kendall Bennett that the firm he is employed by 
(SciTech Software of Southbank Australia) already has a product 
named UniPOWER.  Their product to quote Ken "is a set of DPMS 
Monitor power management utilities and screensavers for DOS and 
Windows (maybe Linux one day)."  They politely asked me to change 
the name, so I did.  If you want any information on SciTech 
Software's UniPOWER product, Ken's e-mail address is 
KendallB@scitechsoft.com.

Erwin Authried, dropped me a line offering some patches if I 
wanted to have unipower be configurable at run time.  Turns out 
that Erwin pretty much rewrote a good portion of unipowerd, and 
did it a lot better than I probably could have.  He also provided 
cable information for his Victron Lite UPS.

Marek Michalkiewicz also sent patches to enable unipower to use 
the serial data transmit lines to shut the inverter down, and to 
check that the inverter was actually killed.  Marek also provided 
a Linux specific APC cable, and a host of good comments to the 
documentation.

This is pretty much maintenance release to incorporate Erwin and 
Marek's patches, change the name, and do a little cleaning up.  
I'm still trying to get some of the stuff in the TODO list done 
(I'm also planning on including it in the distribution this time 
:->).


1.0.0 (1995/04/09)

The first general release of the unipower package.

Changed Jim Ockers' cable design and added warning about APC 
Back-UPS 400 series UPSs not providing +24V, per Jim's feedback.  
Also made some spelling corrections to the source code at Jim's 
request.

At Corey Sweeny's request, I tried to make the plea to use 
commercial cables a little stronger.  Neither of us are wizards 
with a soldering iron and I don't think we should expect unipower 
users to be either.  This makes the homebrewed cables a weak link 
in the reliability of the package.  I plan to continue 
presenting, and even expanding, the section on homebrewed cables 
for those users who feel comfortable using them.

There were no real programmatic changes to the unipower package 
between the 0.2.2 beta and version 1.0.0.  I hope this means that 
it is working well for all of the beta testers, and will work 
well for the Linux community.


0.2.2 beta (1995/02/14)

Added additional logging to unipowerd.  More changes to the 
documentation.  Added unitest to the package.  Fixed stupid 
problem in unipowerfail to allow LOWBATTERY conditions to be 
handled properly.  Several new cable for APC UPSs contributed by 
beta testers.  Added INVERTERTIME define to unipowerd.h files to 
allow configuration of the amount of time INVERTERBIT is held 
high.

***** SWITCHED HIGH/LOW VALUES IN THE PROVIDED unipowerd.h FILES.
***** The old configuration files should still work, but users 
***** should adopt the new terminology since it is a little 
***** saner.


0.2.1 beta (1995/01/15)

Documentation has been cleaned up some more.  Programs synched to 
a consistent revision number (equal to the release).


0.2 beta (1994/11/04)

First version to be released for limited beta testing.  First 
rough draft of documentation.  Added -k option to unipowerd.  
Removed unikill from the package as redundant.  Created unified 
Makefile for unipowerd package.  General cleanup of unipower 
package.


0.1 beta (1994/04/20)

First version of unipower package.  Not released to public.
